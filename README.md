### Insurance Prediction  

**Project Overview**  
This project focuses on predicting insurance metrics using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze and model the relationship between features and target variables, ensuring high prediction accuracy and interpretability.  

**Key Features**  
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Encoding of categorical variables to convert them into a machine-readable format.  
  - Splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets for model evaluation.  

- **Regression Techniques:**  
  - **Linear Regression:** Used as the baseline model to establish relationships between predictors and the target variable.  
  - **Decision Tree:** Implemented for its ability to handle non-linear relationships and its interpretability in understanding feature importance.  

- **Model Validation:**  
  - Cross-validation techniques are used to ensure model generalization across different data splits.  
  - Performance evaluation with key metrics:  
    - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** Measures average absolute error in predictions.  
    - **MSE (Mean Squared Error):** Penalizes larger errors, highlighting outlier impact.  
    - **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** Provides error magnitude in the same units as the target variable.  

**Insights**  
- Effective data preprocessing (e.g., encoding and train-test split) is critical for accurate predictions.  
- Decision Trees offer high interpretability, helping identify which features contribute most to predictions.  
- Error metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE) provide valuable feedback for comparing and refining models.  
- This project demonstrates the trade-off between model complexity and generalization.
